## Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project uses an LSTM model, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on historical stock prices and can predict prices for the next `n` days.

## Features
- **Historical Data Fetching**: Automatically downloads historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- **LSTM Model**: Uses a pre-trained LSTM model for stock price prediction.
- **Future Prediction**: Predicts stock prices for the next `n` days.
- **Visualization**: Plots historical and predicted stock prices for easy comparison.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git

## usage
   jupyter notebook stock_price_prediction.ipynb
   
   # Set the stock ticker and prediction horizon:
  ticker = 'AAPL'  # Change this to any stock symbol (e.g., 'TSLA', 'GOOGL')
future_days = 30  # Number of days to predict into the future
